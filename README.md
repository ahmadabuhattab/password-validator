# password-validator
This is a password validator I made. Almost every big company like Youtube, Instagram, Facebook and even Netflix use this method of password validating. It will tell you if your missing a capital, lowercase, number, symbol, or even if its under 8 letters. It will let you know if your missing a certain condition by printing out what is missing.
